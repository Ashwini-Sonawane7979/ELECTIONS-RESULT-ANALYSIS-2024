# ELECTIONS-RESULT-ANALYSIS-2024
I'm excited to present my latest SQL project, which offers an in-depth analysis of the 2024 Indian General Election results. Through the development and execution of sophisticated SQL queries, I've extracted significant insights and identified key trends from the election data. The main features of this analysis include:

Alliance Performance 🏛️:

Detailed results showcasing the number of seats secured by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (I.N.D.I.A).
Introduction of a new column to categorize parties, enhancing the clarity of alliance compositions.
Winning Insights 🏆:

State-Specific Breakdown 🗺️:

An in-depth analysis of Maharashtra, including:
